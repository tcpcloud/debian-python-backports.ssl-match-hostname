Description: The ssl.match_hostname() function from Python 3.4
 .
 The Secure Sockets layer is only actually *secure*
 if you check the hostname in the certificate returned
 by the server to which you are connecting,
 and verify that it matches to hostname
 that you are trying to reach.
 .
 But the matching logic, defined in `RFC2818`_,
 can be a bit tricky to implement on your own.
 So the ``ssl`` package in the Standard Library of Python 3.2
 and greater now includes a ``match_hostname()`` function
 for performing this check instead of requiring every application
 to implement the check separately.
 .
 This backport brings ``match_hostname()`` to users
 of earlier versions of Python.
 Simply make this distribution a dependency of your package,
 and then use it like this::
 .
     from backports.ssl_match_hostname import match_hostname, CertificateError
